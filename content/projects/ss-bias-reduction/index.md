This project examines the performance of three bias reduction techniques for Maximum Likelihood Estimation in GLMs:

Asymptotic Bias Correction - Adjusts MLE estimates using first-order bias approximation
Firth's Method - Modifies the score function to reduce bias while preserving invariance properties
Log-F Prior Method - A Bayesian-inspired technique that allows incorporation of prior information
